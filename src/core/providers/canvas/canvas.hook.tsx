  This is a wrapper for useState

  In this case we want to execute some function whenever the state change

  For instance Undo / Redo functionallity.

  Whenever you do a setState you want to store it in the queue of changes
  so you can undo it later, instead of having to remember to call storeInUndoQueue
  you can just call _setState_ and it will do it for you.
